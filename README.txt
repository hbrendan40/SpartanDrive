Technology Choices
There are a number of things we used for our app to be a success. 
xCode: Very basic so we can work on our app as a whole using swift.
Firebase: We used this as our cloud so we can upload and manage our files.
Cocoa pods: Inside the software, we used cocoa pods so we use them to hook up the firebase.
Google Drive: Since our project was based on google drive we took keen notes and observations on how it works and we also used it for uploading files even code sometimes to make backups.
Slack: We had great communication, we made a slack channel at the start of the semester which helped us all stay in touch and transparent.
Marvelapp: We used marveappl.com to make a prototype of how our app would look like when it is done.
Github: Very obvious choice to push code and stay updated with all the work that was done within the group.
Sketch.io: We used sketch.io to make the theme of our app and later import it to our project. 

Description of Features with Final Screenshots

Wireframe

The wireframe is just how the app is connected with each other. How our app interacts with each button. Here we can see which page is connected to another page and what is the pathway of our app. 
Login

The get started screen is just to enhance our user experience making and expression and highlighting that we put in a lot of hours into developing a better UI with a single button called get started. 
Then we have the login screen with various options such as email login, facebook login, google login or just create a new account using the new user button. 
Create Account

This is our page where an account is made with simple easy to understand yet creative UI.
User Profile

This page shows the user's profile info. It provides you information on your profile which email you are using and the number of uploads one has.
Home Page

Our homepage is the first thing the user lands on after login. Here you can see your previous uploads with the name and the date. Further, you can upload another picture by clicking on the top left corner of the screen. You can also choose to view your shared pictures or find a picture or view your settings. 
Upload


This is the upload screen which comes up after you click on the top left corner of the screen and the first image has empty fields. After you click on the upload image icon it takes you to your local gallery and there you can choose your image. It grabs the default name from the gallery. You have the option to share using email. You can make it private or keep it public so another non-shared user can access it with search option. 
Share

This is how the shared screen looks like. It gives you information on the name and date of the image. It also tells you about the email or emails you shared it with.
Search

The search feature lets browse your own file or other peoples public uploads with pinpoint accuracy. It also lets you know about the user who uploaded the image. 
Edit

The user can always edit the name and shared field i.e. they can unshare the picture. This obviously applies to their own personal uploads. 
Settings


This is our setting tabs which contain three buttons profile, help and log out. Profile and help buttons take one to their respective pages, while logout takes us to the login page. 
Help

The help page provides general directions and instructions on how to operate the app.
